              <strong>Counselling</strong><br />
              One in four people will experience mental ill health throughout
              their life. So how can counselling be beneficial? Counselling is a
              confidential service where clients meet a qualified professional
              for regular sessions usually on a weekly basis for short or long
              term theraputic work. It is a safe space where you are given time
              and space to explore, to discover and work towards a deeper
              understanding of self and improved mental well-being. Talking to
              someone who is not connected to what you are experiencing can hold
              up a different window, another perspective which can help
              facilitate change.

              <br />
              <br />

              People seek support and help for events, issues that have happened
              in the past, that are happening in the present and that can impact
              on the future. <br /><br />

              <strong>People may experience:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>• Anxiety & Depression</li>
              <li>• Loneliness</li>
              <li>• Trauma</li>
              <li>• Relationships</li>
              <li>• Sexuality</li>
              <li>• Self Esteem</li>
              <li>• Bereavement</li>

            </ul>

              If you want to move on to the next step and make an initial
              appointment to see if you would like to book more sessions.

              <strong>Appointments </strong><br />

              The initial appointment is an opportunity to discuss what your
              expectations are and what you want to achieve from counselling;
              also if we can work together therapeutically. The initial
              appointment is longer than a normal session but the cost is still
              the same. After the appointment there will be time to reflect and
              think about if I am the right counsellor for you. If you decide
              that I am the right counsellor for you subsequent sessions can
              then be booked.<br /><br />

              <strong>Candy’s Private Practice</strong><br />
              My practice is situated within my flat in a quiet, residential
              street in a courtyard behind security gates which is accessible by
              bus, Overground, DLR and South Eastern trains. Resident parking is
              between 09-17hrs Monday to Friday but I can provide resident
              permits..
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Costs</strong><br />
              Individual assessment 60-90 minutes £60<br />
              Couples assessment 60-90 minutes £100<br /><br />
              Individual session 50 minutes £60 <br />
              Couples sesssion 60 minutes £100<br /><br />

              Sessions are payable by cash at the end of the session or by bank
              transfer, if you need an invoice one can be produced. I will offer
              some low cost sessions for people who are experiencing financial
              hardship but these sessions will happen during the day, but places
              are limited and there can be waiting list.
