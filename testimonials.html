              Candy is a godsend! Honestly what can I say without sounding
              mushy? Words can't fully express my gratitude, but I'll try. I
              genuinely believe I wouldn't be where I am today without her.
              Working with Candy has been fantastic; she's firm but fair,
              accommodating while holding you accountable - very needed for
              personal growth.
              <br /><br />
              She's both warm and caring, as well as confronting when
              necessary—everything you need in a person-centered therapist. I'm
              so grateful to have worked with her over the past two years.
              <br /><br />
              When I first started working with Candy, I was single and
              insecure. Now, I'm with the love of my life, feeling more
              confident and authentic than ever. I owe so much of my growth to
              Candy. I truly believe I wouldn't have met my partner without her
              guidance. She gave me exactly what I needed, exactly when I needed
              it, and I am incredibly grateful.
              <br /><br />
              I'm in awe of my transformation, from where I was to where I am
              now. Thank you, Candy, thank you so much for everything you've
              given me.
              <br /><br />
              All my love, ❤️
              <br /><br />

              There are not enough words to express how great Candy is as a
              Counsellor and overall person. She has helped me overcome some of
              my darkest times and she has been always supportive, understanding
              and open. Thanks to her help and support, I was able to find my
              true self and live my truth. She has helped me manage and overcome
              anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, sexual assault, racial
              trauma, family dynamics, and toxic relationships. Because of the
              time I spent working with her I am a better and happier person.
              <br /><br />
              Candy is also very well organised, flexible, understanding, and
              accommodating of changing circumstances. I really appreciated the
              clear rules and boundaries that we had in place which allowed me
              to open up and work through my mental health issues. I will always
              be grateful for the support and guidance that she has given me.
              <br /><br />
              Thank you!
              <br /><br />
              All the best
              <br /><br />

              Candy was able to give me the tools and confidence to take control
              of the stresses in my life. By having the language to describe
              complicated relationships and anxieties around queer identity,
              Candy helped empower me to take action in prioritizing my needs in
              only a short amount of time.
              <br /><br />
              Thanks again for your help!
              <br /><br />

              Having been in and out of therapy for over a decade, but never
              truly finding a therapist or counsellor that challenged me or
              understood my experience in the way that I needed, meeting Candy
              was a breath of fresh air. I needed help exploring my gender
              identity and reclaiming my authentic self after years of pushing
              it aside in favour of self doubt and a heavily subdued sense of
              self worth.
              <br /><br />
              Having access to reasonably priced, flexible and LGBTQ+ informed
              counsellor had been something that I was actively looking for, and
              I found it in my sessions with Candy. She is knowledgable, kind
              but firm and unashamedly authentic. All the things that you need
              to demonstrate how it is possible to find that within yourself. I
              have felt supported, encouraged and guided throughout my sessions
              in order to access those parts of myself necessary to overcome my
              mental ill health and unlock my potential.
              <br /><br />
              Candy has be readily available for those instances where, outside
              our usual meetings, I have needed her support. Her compassion and
              flexibility are a testament to her and the support she can provide
              to those suffering with mental ill health. I have seen Candy for
              almost two years and now feel fully equipped with the tools needed
              to face any future hurdles that may come my way. I will not
              hesitate to see her once again if I feel that I need reminding of
              those tools or all the hard work that we have done together over
              the years. It has been very hard work but extremely beneficial and
              for that I am immeasurably grateful. I would would recommend Candy
              as a counsellor to all those who need the support.
              <br /><br />
              Look after yourself

              Can't thank you enough
              <br /><br />
              I needed to say, thank you so much for the love and support you
              gave me during our time together. You taught me how to trust
              myself and love the person I am and I am so grateful. Thanks to
              you, I'm thriving! You're an incredible person and so amazing at
              what you do.
